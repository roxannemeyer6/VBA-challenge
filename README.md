# VBA-challenge
This challenge was to create code that would analyze various stock tickers over a few years.
The code eliminates the duplicates for the stock ticker symbols, then calculates that stock's yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume.
I also created code to conditionally format the yearly changes such that values that are positive are green, and negative values are red.
Lastly, I created a summary of the tickers with the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and greatest total volume.
This code loops through each of the worksheets, so if additional years are added, it would also apply the code.
I have annotated my code throughout for the functions of various lines, and added citations as needed.
